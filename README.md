Fithut is a mobile app that works as a personal gym. In this app, users can choose the equipments they own from a list and pick the part of the body they want to exercise that that or let the app choose for them using the 'Randomize' option.

An unique routine is created taking into account the equipment the user owns and the part of the body the cose to exercise. There is a screen in which the users can see their log history that shows the exercises they made.
